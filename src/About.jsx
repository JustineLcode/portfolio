                <p>After 7 years as a physiotherapist in geriatrics and 3 years working in invasive and non-invasive cardiac rhythmology, I made the decision to transition into a new career as a Web Developer.

During my time in cardiac rhythmology, I discovered my passion for algorithms while working on the settings of pacemakers and defibrillators. This experience sparked my curiosity for technology and logic-based problem solving, leading me to pursue web development.

I am now fully committed to developing my skills and bringing the same dedication, precision, and adaptability that I demonstrated in my previous roles to this new field.</p>
